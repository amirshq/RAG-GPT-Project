# Function calling and addressing the LLM knowledge cut-off with real-time web search using GPT models

**WebGPT** is a powerful tool enabling users to pose questions that require internet searches. Leveraging GPT models:
* It identifies and executes the most relevant given Python functions in response to user queries. 
* The second GPT model generates responses by combining user queries with content retrieved from the web search engine. 
* The user-friendly interface is built using Streamlit
* The web search supports diverse searches such as text, news, PDFs, images, videos, maps, and instant responses. 
* Overcoming knowledge-cutoff limitations, the chatbot delivers answers based on the latest internet content.

## Running the Project

To get the project up and running, you'll need to set up your environment and install the necessary dependencies. You can do this in two ways:

### Option 1: Using the Parent Directory Instructions

Follow the instruction on the [parent directory](https://github.com/Farzad-R/LLM-playground/tree/master) to create an environment and install required libraries. 

### Option 2: Installing Dependencies Individually
If you prefer to install the dependencies individually, run the following command:

```
pip install streamlit==1.28.2 streamlit-chat==0.1.1 duckduckgo-search==3.9.6 openai==0.28.0
```

1. **Configuration and Execution**
* Navigate to the config directory.
* Open cfg.py and fill in your GPT API credentials.
2. **Activate Your Environment.**
3. **Ensure you are in the WebGPT directory**
4. **Run the Application:**

In Terminal:

```
streamlit run webgpt_app.py
```
